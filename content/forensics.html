<p>The Janecka Genomics Lab has extensive experience with population genetics and genomics. Dr. Janecka pioneered snow leopard noninvasive analysis and published the first study on phylogeography of this species, the first annotation and functional assembly of horse Y chromosome. With over 19 years of experience conductung DNA analysis and microsatellite genotyping, the Janecka lab has brought wildlife forensics testing to western Pennsylvania. Dr. Janecka has publihshed over 50 manuscripts in numerous books and journals including <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature Communications</em>, and <em>Curreny Biology</em>. Over the past year we have leveraged this experience and applied it to wildlife forensics by working with the PA Game Cimmission.
