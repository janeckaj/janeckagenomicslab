### Wildlife Forensics

Over the last 3 years, we have developed molecular forensic panels for DNA analysis of white-tailed deer and American black bear. These panels include genetic markers for species and sex determination, individual identification, and DNA matching. In many cases, these markers can also be used to estimate relatedness and kinship. We can also perform identification of deer and dog hair using microscopy. Over the last 2 years we have successfully processed 8 cases for the PA Game Commission from both Southwestern and Northwestern Regions and now welcome opportunities to expand our forensic services to other areas of Pennsylvania, and additional states. We are able to provide references from previous customers.

Starting in January 2021, we strive to deliver a turn-around time of less than 5 weeks from receipt of your samples in the lab (not including holidays). If your analysis takes longer we will provide a 10% discount. If you require expedited analysis shorter than 5 weeks we may be able to accommodate you; please discuss this with us before submitting samples.

To submit a cases please follow these steps:

1. Contact Dr. Janecka to provide basic information in order to obtian a quote, and the sample submission and chain of custody forms.

2. Fill out the forms and arrange for delivery to the lab. You can either ship them with an appropriate carrier or drop them off. Please send us an email confirmation when you mail your samples.

3. We will email you a confirmation that we received your samples and start processing them within 2 business days.

4. Once they are analyzed we will send you a final report and invoice. Payment is due within 1 month of receiving the invoice. Payments can be made via check or credit card.

Please contact Dr. Janecka if you would like to discuss a potential case. The genetic markers for white-tailed deer and black bear in our samples were selected from among the most variable loci observed in North America based on numerous published studies, therefore, they are informative for DNA matching in most other states and regions.

We also use other mtDNA, sex, and microsatellite markers for research purposes on the following species: snow leopard, common leopard, tiger, cheetah, African lion, domestic cat, ocelot, bobcat, and African white-bellied pangolin. We can perform customized analyses on these taxa for interested customers.

##### Pricing

| Analysis | 1-9 samples &nbsp; &nbsp; | 10+ samples |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------|
| Species Determination only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | $100 | $85 |
| Sex Determination only | $120 | $100 |
| Individual Identification &#x00B9; | $180 | $150 |  
| Relatedness/Kinship &#x00B2;  | $220 | $180 |  

1. *Includes species and sex determination bundled individual identification.*
2. *Includes species, sex, and individual identification bundled with additional relatedness analysis.*

NOTE: DNA extraction costs are included in the prices above. We analyze a subset of samples two or more times to ensure reliable results at no additional cost to you.

#### Court Testimony as DNA and Genetics Expert Witness

Dr. Janecka has over 20 years of experience in genetics including sequencing, microsatellite analysis, genotyping, SNP analysis, population genetics, phylogenetics, NGS, Illumina, and numerous other areas. He has taught upper-level Genetics, Bioinformatics, NGS, and Environmental Sampling courses at Duquesne University, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, for over 6 years. In addition, he has published over 50 scientific papers in journals including *Science* and *Nature Genetics* utilizing the genetic methods used in forensics. During the prosecution of your cases he is able to provide expert witness testimony in court. 

#### Genetic Analysis of Widlife Populations Maintained by Zoos and Sanctuaries

We cam provide genetic-based estimates of kinship and relatedness for captive populations in zoos and wildlife sanctuaries. The results can be used to ensure breeding pairs are unrelated, and to maximize long-term genetic variation. We are able perform relatedness analyses for most wild felids (i.e., snow leopards, tigers, lions, cheetahs, bobcats, ocelots, etc.) and domestic cats, deer, black bear, African white-bellied pangolin. We can potentially analyze additional species if there are published molecular markers are available for it. Please let us know if you would like to discuss the potential of our lab analyzing your species.
