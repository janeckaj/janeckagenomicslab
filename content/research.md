### Main Areas: Population Genetics, Phylogenetics, Genomics, Conservation Biology, and Wildlife Forensics

Our lab addresses three fundamental questions in biology: 

(1) How is the distribution and structure of wild populations determined? 
(2) What are the molecular mechanisms that lead to adaptation? 
(3) How do genomic factors contribute to important phenotypes? 

Answering these questions expands our understanding of evolution and ecology, improves conservation and management, and has the potential to advance the treatment of various diseases and genetic disorders. Our projects incorporate diverse fields of biology including population genetics, phylogenetics, genomics, ecology, conservation biology, physiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. It is our goal to apply our knowledge towards both conservationa and sustainable use of natural resources. We therefore have close partnerships with organization such as the Snow Leopard Conservancy, Irbis Mongolia, and Chinese Academy of Sciences, to use the latest genetics methods to design, evaluate, and implement conservation actions.

In order to make concrete contributions to wildlife management locally, the Janecka Genomics Lab recently expanded into wildlife forensics by establishing a DNA testing service for wildlife cases in Pennsylvania. Legal hunting is one of the most important sectors for wildlife conservation and management in North America. The recovery from near-extirpation in the early 1900s was initiated and implemented by hunters and hunting organizations, such as the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and today this strong tradition continues. We support the the efforts of wildlife law enforcement by providing services to the PA Game Commission including species and sex determination, DNA matching, and relatedness estimation for white-tailed deer and American black bear (please see more information on our [Services page]({{< ref "services" >}} "Janecka Genomics Lab Services"). If you are interested in submitting samples for forensics testing please contact Dr. Janecka.

### Diverse Research Projects 

One of our main areas of focus is on the snow leopard, which occurs in high-altitude mountains of Asia. We use noninvasive genetics and genomics to study this elusive felid in countries including Mongolia, Pakistan, and China. We work with many partners including Snow Leopard Conservancy, Mongolian Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Irbis Mongolia, and Panthera. Recently, we have developed a novel cell culture model in collaboration with Dr. Phil Auron's lab to explore the physiological adaptations of snow leopards to high-altitude using blood generously provided by zoos and wildlife sanctuaries.

Various approaches are integrated to understand distribution, phylogeography, population structure, prey use, diet ecology, and the adaptations that have enabled snow leopards to thrive in the high-altitude ecosystems they inhabit. This cat shares recent ancestry with the tiger, which occurs at low elevations. By studying the genomics and cells function of both wild and captive populations of these two species, we are beginning to understand the changes that occurred during speciation. In addition, the information we obtain has important ramifications for conservation and management and we work closely with government institutions and NGOs translate our work into conservation actions.

We are examining genomics of bobcats in order to elucidate how species adapt to different environmental variables. The research on bobcats not only includes sequencing genomes, but also camera trapping in Powdermill Nature Reserve and Penguin Court to examine distribution in southwestern Pennsylvania. 

Our lab is also partnering with numerous collaborators to study other species. For example, we are  doing research on the genomics of Dromedarian camels in Oman. In this region, the camel is one of the most valuable domestic animals, both culturally and economically; we are therefore examining its genomic diversity and breed structure. As part of partnership with the Pangolin Consortium, Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium, and numerous other zoos we are studying the genetics of African white-bellied pangolins. Working with colleagues at Texas A&M University, particularly Dr. Terje Raudsepp, we continue to be involved in the genomics and function of the horse Y chromosome. Another aspect of our research is looking at the evolution of mammals. We are collaborating with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and several other institutions to examine patterns of mammalian diversification in the early Paleocene, just after the extinction of the dinosaurs. 

### Putting Science to Work

We consider it very important to apply biological research in away that positively impacts wildlife. We work with government organizations and NGOs to provide information for designing and implementing conservation actions in Asia. For example, we are workign with in-country partners evaluate methods to reduce livestock depredation, such as FoxLights, and spread their use on the Tibetan Plateau.

Closer to home, we recently established a DNA forensics testing service of deer and bear to assist Wildlife Conservation Officers in processing their cases. It is our goal to support the PA Game Commission, and other state and federal agencies, in enforcing wildlife laws. We are working on expanding the number of species we can test and also the regions from which we can analyze cases.
