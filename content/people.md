Dr. Janecka is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Duquesne. He also serves as an Associate of the Snow Leopard Conservancy, and a member of the IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, and the Snow Leopard Network.

He received his B.S. degree in Biology from Cornell University. He examined social structure and dispersal of bobcats for his Master's thesis in Wildlife and Fisheries Biology at University of Vermont. His Ph.D. dissertation from Texas A&M University examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity of ocelots. For his post-doctoral research, Dr. Janecka studied mammalian phylogenetics, patterns in the diversification of mammals, speciation of colugos, and snow leopard conservation genetics. He has conducted field expeditions, trained biologists, and taught genetics in numerous Asian Countries including Mongolia, China, Nepal, India, and Bhutan. 

Currently, Dr. Janecka's laboratory is primarily focusing on conservation genetics and genomics of snow leopards, molecular adaptation of bobcats to diverse environmental conditions, genomics of the Dromedarian camel in Oman, and evolution of mammals in the Paleocene. His laboratory has also recently established DNA testing services in wildlife forensics for the PA Game Commission. 

At Duquesne, Dr. Janecka teaches BIOL 250 Genetics (Spring), BIOL/BTGY 419/519: Bioinformatics: Analysis of Molecular and Genomic Data (Fall), and BIOL/ENVI 494/594 Environmental Sampling (Summer - odd years), and Advanced Topics classes in the Biology Department.

I am a conservation biologist focused on using molecular tools via noninvasive genetics to better understand the ecology, behavior, natural history, and human dimensions of at-risk mammalian species. I supplement my work with traditional ecology methods and social science to achieve a more holistic picture of the functional roles species play in their respective ecosystems. My PhD research surrounds the threatened snow leopard (*Panthera uncia*), a charismatic big cat endemic to the mountains of Central Asia. Despite their status as a recognizable flagship species, knowledge gaps surrounding snow leopard population status, natural history, and ecology persist. I aim to help bridge these gaps by determining population parameters and viability, how biogeographic events have shaped the species, resource use and dependency of livestock, and how human attitudes towards predators are shaped.

#### MS Students

**Jim Neugenbauer**

![](/./people_files/jim-400.jpg)

Jim is a Master’s student in Duquesne’s Center for Environmental Research and Education (CERE). He received his undergraduate degree from Duquesne University and has taken classes from the University of Montana, University of Salamanca, and Cornell University. His interests in research vary but always have a key focus on wildlife. In the Janecka Lab, Jim studies bobcat populations in Pennsylvania through camera trapping. He hopes to find connections between image capture and differences in meteorological or geographical features of the area. Jim also researches black bear populations in Pennsylvania through genetic analysis. He hopes to better understand how black bears are related across the state and what geographic features may be limiting their movements. Jim also has strong interests in data science, foreign language, and the North American model of wildlife conservation.
