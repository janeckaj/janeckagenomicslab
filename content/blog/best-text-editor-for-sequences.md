### Best text editor for working with sequences

One of the issues that often comes up while working with sequences is being able to view the ones that you have compiled in a fasta file. Programs that are specifically designed to open, read, and analyze sequences as nucleotides (or amino acids) often do not allow you to easily edit or manipulate the names and sequences themselves. I have found that it is easiest to initially start by pasting sequences into a flat text file with a simple text editor (unless of course you are dealing with NGS).

But which text editor? Main problem is that some text editors will wrap the sequences after a certain page width. Other programs will by default save for file as a .rtf, alhtough this is easy to change it just adds one more thing to have to remember to do. Then there are some programs that are available on Windows, but not on Mac, or vice versa.

However, there is one simple solution - the text editor in MEGA. It works great for seqeunces. It is built into the the MEGA program, which is a comprehensive sequence analysis suite. From my experience, few people use (or even realize) it has its own text editor. MEGA comes in all OS flavors so everyone can now use the same one.

The way to access it is simply through the main menu window of MEGA. Just go to "File"" > "Edit a Text File". This opens up the "Text Editor and Format Converter". Now select "File" > "Open" and navigate to the folder with your fasta text file. Once you open it, you can easily modify the text of your sequences, copy paste sequences, search and replace text.

Why did I spend time writing about this? Because this short tip will save you time and aggravation, trust me.

Below are some advantages of using a text editor in MEGA for sequences. You can do some of these in other text editors, however the last few are specifically advantages of using the one in MEGA

- you can scroll and scroll and scroll to the right, this way you can see where the sequence end, and if you are looking at an alignment can visually recognize problems.

- let's say you ambiguous bases are coded by "?" but you need to have them coded by "N", you can do a simple find & replace and re-save, without the program adding any hidden characters or otherwise corrupting your flat text file

- you can quickly edit sequence names or change the format of the sequences

- you can make these changes and then go back to the main page and re-import the fasta text file into the alignment tool all in one program.

- you can reverse complement a sequence

- you can merge lines

- remove or insert spaces and digits
