### Main areas: Population Genetics, Phylogenetics, Genomics, Conservation Biology, and Wildlife Forensics

Our lab addresses three fundamental questions in biology: 

(1) How is the distribution and structure of wild populations determined? 
(2) What are the molecular mechanisms that lead to adaptation? 
(3) How do genomic factors contribute to important phenotypes? 

Answering these questions expands our understanding of evolution and ecology, improves conservation and management, and has the potential to advance the treatment of various diseases and genetic disorders. Our projects incorporate diverse fields of biology including population genetics, phylogenetics, genomics, ecology, conservation biology, physiology, and bioinformatics. 

In order to make concrete contributions to wildlife management, the Janecka Genomics Lab recently expanded into wildlife forensics by establishing a DNA testing service for poaching cases in Pennsylvania. The services we provided are species identification, DNA matching, relatedness estimation for white-tailed deer and American black bear (please see more information on our Services page). Currently, we analyze samples for the PA Game Commission, but we welcome opportunities to expand our services to other states and covering more species. If you are interested in submitting samples for forensics testing please contact Dr. Janecka.

### Diverse Research Projects 

One of our main areas of focus is on the snow leopard, which occurs in high-altitude mountains of Asia. We use noninvasive genetics to study this elusive felid in countries including Mongolia, Pakistan, and China. We work with many partners including Mongolian Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Irbis Mongolia, Snow Leopard Conservancy, and Panthera.

Various approaches are used to understand distribution, phylogeography, population structure, prey use, and the adaptations that have enabled snow leopards to thrive in high-altitude ecosystems. This cat shares recent ancestry with the tiger, which occurs at low elevations. By studying the genomics of both wild and captive populations of these two species, we are beginning to understand the changes that occurred during their speciation. In addition, the information we obtain has important ramifications for conservation and management. 

Our lab is also examining genomics of bobcats in order to elucidate how species adapt to different environmental variables. The research on bobcats not only includes sequencing genomes, but also camera trapping in Powdermill Nature Reserve and Penguin Court to examine distribution in southwestern Pennsylvania. We have begun to diversify our lab regarding the species we are studying. For example, we are now doing research on the genomics of Dromedarian camels in Oman. In this region, the camel is one of the most valuable domestic animals, both culturally and economically; we are therefore examining its genomic diversity and breed structure.

Another aspect of our research is looking at the evolution of mammals. We are collaborating with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and several other institutions to examine patterns of mammalian diversification in the early Paleocene, just after the extinction of the dinosaurs. 

### Putting Science to Work

Finally, we consider it very important to also apply biological research to positively impact wildlife. We work with government organizations and NGOs to provide information for conservation actions in Asia. In addition, we work with in-country partners evaluate methods to reduce livestock depredation, such as FoxLights.

The methods we use for noninvasive genetics, such microsatellite profiling to identify individual snow leopards from scat, are the same ones used in forensics to match samples collected at a crime scene. We therefore recently established a DNA testing service of deer for poaching cases submitted by Wildlife Conservation Officers. It is our goal to support the PA Game Commission in enforcing wildlife laws. We are working on expanding the number of species we can test and also the regions from which we can analyze cases.
