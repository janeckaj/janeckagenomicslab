### Wildlife Forensics

Over the last 3 years, we have developed molecular forensic panels for DNA analysis of white-tailed deer and American black bear. These panels include genetic markers for species and sex identification, individual identification, and DNA matching. In many cases, these markers can also be used to estimate relatedness and kinship. In addition, we can perform identification of deer and dog hair using microscopy. Over the last 2 years we have successfully processed 8 cases for the PA Game Commission from both Southwestern and Northwestern Regions and now welcome opportunities to expand our forensic services to other areas of Pennsylvania, and additional states. We are able to provide references from previous customers if you are not familiar with our lab.

Starting in January 2021, we strive to deliver a turn-around time of 5 weeks from receipt of your samples in the lab (not including holidays). If your analysis takes longer we will provide a 10% discount. If you require expedited analysis shorter than 5 weeks we may be able to accommodate you; please discuss this with us before submitting samples.

To submit a cases please follow these steps:

1. Contact Dr. Janecka to provide basic information in order to obtian a quote, and the sample submission and chain of custody forms.

2. Fill out the forms and arrange for delivery to the lab. You can either ship them with an appropriate carrier or drop them off. Please send us an email confirmation when you mail your samples.

3. We will email you a confirmation that we received your samples and start processing them within 2 business days.

4. Once they are analyzed we will send you a final report and invoice. Payment is due within 1 month of receiving the invoice. Payments can be made via check or credit card.

Please contact Dr. Janecka if you would like to discuss a potential case. The genetic markers for white-tailed deer and black bear in our samples were selected from among the most variable loci observed in North America based on numerous published studies, therefore, they are informative for DNA matching in most other states and regions.

We also use other mtDNA, sex, and microsatellite markers for research purposes on the following species: snow leopard, common leopard, tiger, cheetah, African lion, domestic cat, ocelot, bobcat, and African white-bellied pangolin. We can perform customized analyses on these taxa for interested customers.

#### Pricing

| Analysis | 1-9 samples &nbsp; &nbsp; | 10+ samples |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------|
| Species Determination only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | $100 | $85 |
| Sex Determination only | $120 | $85 |
| Individual Identification &#x00B9; | $180 | $153 |  
| Relatedness/Kinship &#x00B2;  | $220 | $187 |  

1. *Includes species and sex determination bundled individual identification.*

2. *Includes species, sex, and individual identification bundled with additional relatedness analysis.*

NOTE: DNA extraction costs are included in the prices above. In addition, we analyze a subset of samples two or more times to ensure reliable results at no additional cost to you.

### Genetic Analysis of Captive Populations

We have previously provided genetic based estimates of kinship and relatedness for captive populations in zoos and wildlife sanctuaries, including cheetahs and African white-bellied pangolins. The results can be used to ensure breeding pairs are unrelated, and to maximize long term genetics variation. We are able perform relatedness analyses for most wild felids and domestic cats, deer, black bear, African white-bellied pangolin. We can potential analyze additional species if published molecular markers are available. Please let us know if you would like the discuss the possibilities.

### Training

We have provide training to dozens of researchers, biologists, wildlife conservation officers, game wardens, and local communities. This has been both at our lab, seminars, virtual sessions, training modules, presentations and through consulting. Topics include study design, sample collection and storage, genetic analysis (DNA extraction, PCR, Microsatellite genotyping, SNPs, sequencing, Illumina sequencing, NGS libary prep). 

We also provide resources and information on genetics and it application. Our blog has articles covering topics in genetics and genetic analysus. Dr. Janecka hosts a YouTube chanel Janecka Genomics where he posts training videos. Currently, these focus on bioinformatics. This spring he will also make videos that cover noninvsasive genetic analysis of snow leopard populations. Subscribe to his channel to get notified when new material is posted. 

### Court Testimony as DNA and Genetics Expert Witness

Dr. Janecka has over 20 years of experience in genetic analysis including sequencing, microsatellite analysis, genotyping, SNP analysis, population genetics, phylogenetics, and RNAseq analysis. He has taught upper-level Genetics and Bioinforamtics courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels for over 6 years. In addition, he has published over 50 scientific papers in journals including *Science* and *Nature Genetics* utilizing the genetic methods used in forensics. He is able to provide expert witness testimony in court. Please contact him for more information.
